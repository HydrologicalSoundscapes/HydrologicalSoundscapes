      This app was imagined by <a href="https://globxblog.inrae.fr/about">
        Benjamin Renard
      </a>
      who expored hydrological data sonification quite a bit using R (see for example
      the
      <a href="https://github.com/benRenard/sequenceR"> sequenceR </a> package).
      It came to life thanks to his motivation and initiative.
    </div>
    <div class="sonification">
      The data sonification was for the most part based on previous work from
      Benjamin Renard to which Ivan Horner brought some contributions.
    </div>
    <div class="ihdev">
      The app was coded by <a href="https://ihdev.fr" target="_blank">
        Ivan Horner (ihdev.fr)
      </a>, free-lance developer dedicated to the valorization and vulgarization
      of science.
